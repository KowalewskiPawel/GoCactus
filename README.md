- Android Studio or Xcode for native development
- A paired PicoGo robot

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KowalewskiPawel/SenorCactus.AI.git
cd SenorCactus.AI
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```

4. Run on your device or emulator:
   - Press 'a' for Android
   - Press 'i' for iOS
   - Scan the QR code with Expo Go app

## ü§ñ Robot Setup

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- PicoGo robot platform
- MicroPython environment

### Flashing the Robot

1. Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer
2. Flash MicroPython to the Pico
3. Copy the following files to the Pico:
   - `main.py` - Main control program
   - `Motor.py` - Motor control library
   - `ws2812.py` - RGB LED control
   - `TRSensor.py` - Sensor interface

### Bluetooth Pairing

1. Turn on the robot
2. Pair with the robot from your mobile device's Bluetooth settings
3. The robot's Bluetooth name will appear as "PicoGo" or similar

## üéØ Using Se√±or Cactus

### Manual Control
1. Open the app and connect to your robot via Bluetooth
2. Use the directional buttons to control movement
3. Adjust speed using the speed buttons
4. Control accessories (LED, buzzer) using the corresponding buttons

### Voice Control
1. Connect to your robot via Bluetooth
2. Tap "Start Voice Assistant" to connect to the OpenAI Realtime API
3. Press and hold the microphone button to speak
4. Release to get a response from Se√±or Cactus
5. Ask Se√±or Cactus to move or perform actions:
   - "Move forward"
   - "Turn left"
   - "Change the color to blue"
   - "Make some noise"

## üß© Project Structure

- `app/(tabs)/` - Main app screens
  - `robot.tsx` - Robot control interface
  - `realtime-cactus.tsx` - Voice assistant interface
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `pico-go-code/` - Robot firmware
  - `main.py` - Main robot control program
  - `Motor.py` - Motor control library
  - `ws2812.py` - RGB LED control library

## üîß Customization

### Personality
You can modify Se√±or Cactus's personality by updating the system prompt in `app/(tabs)/realtime-cactus.tsx`:

```javascript
const systemMessage = {
  type: 'session.update',
  session: {
    instructions: `You are SE√ëOR CACTUS, the world's first robotic motivational cactus with a strong Mexican accent...` 
    // Modify this to change personality
  }
};
```

### Control Functions
To add new robot functions, update both:
1. The function definitions sent to the AI in `sendFunctionDefinitions()`
2. The `handleFunctionCall()` implementation to handle the new function
